title: "3D Modeling + \nGenerative ML Models"
layout: home
---

Project Rodin is an investigation into the ability of state-of-the-art generative ML models to synthesize polygonal meshes that could be used in a video game. The project's name comes from Auguste Rodin, a famous French sculptor. Through this project I wish to explore if it is possible to create a pipeline that uses one of these ML models to automatically generate 3D models and then converts them into a format ready for use in a game engine such as Unity.

My work is being done as part of EECS 499 independent study research at the University of Michigan. I will be using this website to post weekly updates on the status of the project, so please check it out!

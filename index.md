This is a development blog chronicling my work with Wolverine Soft Studio on their project this semester. Wolverine Soft is a student game development organization at the University of Michigan that I have helped run for nearly three years now.

The Studio is aiming to develop a 2D platformer game from January to April 2020 as an educational opportunity for its members to learn more about game development on a large team over longer timelines than standard course projects.

This page will be updated biweekly with new posts about my developing progress in my work on the game.

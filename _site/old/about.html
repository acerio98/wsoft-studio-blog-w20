					Hi, I'm Austin! I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying computer science in the School of Engineering. I am originally from Northern Virginia in the DC metro area and graduated in 2016 from the Thomas Jefferson High School of Science and Technology in Alexandria, VA. My background is in iOS front-end development with Swift and Objective-C, though I also have experience with web development and several other languages, as well as Unity game development.
					<br><br>
					I first got into mobile development in mid-2013 when I became interested in making iOS application and taught myself Objective-C. In early 2014 I participated in my first hackathon, PilotDC, where I developed my first complete iOS app, a basic photo-editing painting application. That summer, I picked up the Swift language when it came out, which I applied in other hackathons and my internship at Solebrity the following year.
					<br><br>
					My original desire to learn mobile development partly came from wanting to develop a mobile game, which shift between OpenGL ES and other platforms before finally settling on Unity around 2015. While teaching myself Unity I have worked on my own life-simulation sandbox game, shown on the  "Projects" page. In addition to C# programming, I have also done my own 3D modeling, texturing, and animation using Blender, which I was first introduced to as early as 2012.
					<br><br>
					My traditional programming experience comes from 4 years at TJHSST, as well as courses at the University of Michigan. At TJ I learned Java, my first programming language, as well as Python, C, web app development, and Android app development. At UMich I have taken courses in C++ as well as learning about other tools such as MATLAB. From these five years, I now have a broad range of experience, but I still consider Swift to be my strongest programming language.
					<br><br>
					I love video games, getting up early, and alternative rock. I have a twin brother, speak (some) Japanese, and strive to learn something new every day. <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a> if you'd like to learn more about me and my skills!
